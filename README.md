# Face-Mask-Detection-
# Problem statement- 
The main objective of the face detection model is to detect the face of individuals and conclude whether they are wearing masks or not at that particular moment when they are captured in the image.
# Objective- 
The main purpose of this system is to collect with mask and without mask datasets from online resources in order to create a face mask identification model using CNN deep learning classifier. Face mask recognition from a live web cam is possible with this face mask detector.
# Results-
